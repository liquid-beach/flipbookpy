# flipbookpy 
Flipbook animation program written in python.  
Flip book ASCII art is stored in variables and then a while loop prints each image to the screen.  
After .2 seconds the art is cleared and the next image is printed to the terminal for a seamless flipbook effect.

You may have to adjust the font size in your terminal to view the animation correctly, it was designed for a large screen.
